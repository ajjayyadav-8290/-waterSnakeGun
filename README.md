# 🐍 Snake Water Gun Game — Python CLI Project

This is a simple terminal-based game in Python that simulates the popular *Snake-Water-Gun* game (a variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors). You play against the computer by choosing either **Snake (s)**, **Water (w)**, or **Gun (g)** — and the game decides the winner based on classic rules.

## 🎮 Game Rules

- 🐍 Snake drinks Water → **Snake wins**
- 💧 Water douses Gun → **Water wins**
- 🔫 Gun shoots Snake → **Gun wins**
- Same choices → **It's a Draw**

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The computer randomly chooses one of the three options.
- You input your choice via the command line.
- The game compares both choices and prints the result.
